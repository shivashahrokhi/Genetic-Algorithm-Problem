# Genetic-Algorithm-Problem
Artificial Intelligence Course Project at AUT

This project is an application of Genetic Algorithm for solving the Super Mario game with some limitations.It takes each level of the game as a string and detects the level has a feasible solution or not.If the level is doable the algorithm will calculate the maximum amount of scores that can be reached as the highest score of that level.
